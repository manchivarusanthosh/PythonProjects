Simple Calculator - 2
Write a program to create a menu-driven calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations (+, -, \*, /, and %).
Input

The input will be a single line containing two integers and operator(+, -, \*, /, and %) similar to 3 + 5.
Output

If the given operator is "+", print the sum of two numbers.
If the given operator is "-", print the result of the subtraction of the two numbers.
If the given operator is "\*", print the multiplication of the two numbers.
If the given operator is "/", print the result of the division of the two numbers.
If the given operator is "%", print the result of the modulus operation of the two numbers.
Explanation

For example, if the given operator is "+" and the two numbers are 3 and 5. As it is an addition operator, your code should print the sum of the given two numbers (3 + 5), which is 8.
Similarly, if the given operator is "_" and the two numbers are 2 and 5.
As it is a multiplication operator, your code should print the result of the multiplication of the given two numbers (2 _ 5), which is 10.
Similarly, if the given operator is "-" and the two numbers are 10 and 9.
As it is a subtraction operator, your code should print the result of the subtraction of the given two numbers (10 - 9), which is 1.
